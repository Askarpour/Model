The model presented in older_ versions is mostly related to early versions of our work. You can find more about it by referring to our paper “SAFER-HRC: Safety Analysis Through Formal vERification in Human-Robot Collaboration”, published in  SAFECOMP2016.


However the latest version of the work is much more advanced. It has been expanded in many aspects. Please do not hesitate to contact me on "Mehrnoosh.askarpour@polimi.it" for more detail on the new version.
