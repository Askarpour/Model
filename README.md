The model presented in Version 1 is mostly related to early versions of our work. You can find more about it by referring to our paper “SAFER-HRC: Safety Analysis Through Formal vERification in Human-Robot Collaboration”, published in  SAFECOMP2016.
The model in Version 2, instead, is a more advanced model with Semantics and more focus on non-determinism of th eoperator.


However the on-going version of the work is much more advanced. It is being expanded in many aspects. Please do not hesitate to contact me on "Mehrnoosh.askarpour@polimi.it" for more detail on the new version.
