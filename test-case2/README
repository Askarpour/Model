*This is documentation for SAFEr-HRC, a tool for automated risk analysis of the Human-Robotic Collaborative (HRC) applications.
This tool is complient with standards ISO 10218-2 (Risk Analysis) and ISO 14121 (Risk Estimation).

*This package consists of the following modules:
	
	-	ORL:
		-	O formalizes the model of the operator.
		-	R formalizes the model of the robot.
		-	L contains the physical characteristic of the environment and also the common relative properties of operator and robot (velocity, force, seperation, move direction).
	-	TaskLib:  a package containing formalized descriptions of tasks.

	-	Hazards: List of hazards and their characteristics
	-	REs: Risk Estimation module that works according to ISO 14121.
	-	REv: Risk Evaluation module that evaluates the acceptability of the risk value and interpolates and couples Hazards and Res module with RRMs.
	-	RRM (Risk reduction Measures): Treatments of hazards listed in Hazrads.

The modules above are the main core of the tool, and the remaining files are for working with it.

	- Main: This is like the main of a program and invokes the required blocks from the modules.
	- Properties: Here you can define desired properties that you want the tool to verify. You can also find the configurations of each experiment.
	- Table.py: Is a script that generates readable tables from the outcome of the tool. 
		-python Table.py err  produces results of erroneous behavior detection
		-python Table.py sa   produces results of safety assessment


*How to make it work:

There are seven main blocks within the Main file:
	-	Init: the initiL configuration of the model.
	-	four blocks of the form ExeT_i: each of them generate the required formulae for execution of T-i.
	-	*sys*: Here you should choose which task to execute (incomment the one you selected).
	- run the experiment.
